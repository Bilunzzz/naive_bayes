# Naive Bayes Classifier

## Project Overview
This repository implements a **Naive Bayes classifier** to solve a classification problem. The model is built and tested on a dataset, and it demonstrates how the algorithm works in predicting outcomes based on given features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Social Network Ads** dataset. This dataset contains data points related to user characteristics and whether or not they purchased a product.

### Files:
- **`Social_Network_Ads.csv`**: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- **`naive_bayes.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook where the Naive Bayes classification model is implemented and tested.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, you need the following libraries installed:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: To build and evaluate the Naive Bayes classifier.

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
