#Naive Bayes Classifier
Project Overview
This repository implements a Naive Bayes classifier to solve a classification problem. The model is built and tested on a dataset, and we demonstrate how the algorithm works in predicting outcomes based on given features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Social Network Ads dataset. This dataset contains data points related to user characteristics and whether or not they purchased a product.

Files:
Social_Network_Ads.csv: Contains the dataset used in the project.
naive_bayes.ipynb: Jupyter notebook where the Naive Bayes classification model is implemented and tested.
Getting Started
To run the notebook, you need the following libraries installed:

pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: To build and evaluate the Naive Bayes classifier.
Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Salin kode
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Running the Project
Clone the repository:
bash
Salin kode
git clone https://github.com/Bilunzzz/naive_bayes.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Salin kode
cd naive_bayes
Open and run the naive_bayes.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Naive Bayes Algorithm
The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. It is especially effective for problems with high-dimensional data and is commonly used for text classification, spam filtering, and recommendation systems.

How it Works:
The algorithm calculates the probability of each class given the input data.
It assumes that each feature contributes independently to the probability of the outcome.
Based on the calculated probabilities, it classifies the input data into the most probable class.
Results
The notebook demonstrates the accuracy and performance of the Naive Bayes classifier on the Social Network Ads dataset. It includes:

Data exploration and visualization
Data preprocessing (feature scaling)
Model training and testing
Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
